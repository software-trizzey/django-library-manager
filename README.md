# Library Manager

**Author: Tristan Deane**

## Description

A small full-stack application that allows me to manage my home library.

The main goal of this project is to solidify the Django knowledge i've acquired.

## Stack & Architecture

This project will be a great introduction to integrating a React client with
Django. In general, this project will consist of three main layers.

Layers:

1. Client built with React.js
2. A REST API built with the Django Rest Framework
3. Django backend that will store the data and supply the admin interface.

**Stack used:**

- React.js
- Django Rest Framework
- Django & SQLite
- Host: Likely Heroku or AWS
