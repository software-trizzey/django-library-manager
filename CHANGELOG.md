# Version History

**Version 0.0.2:**

Implemented a REST API with the Django Rest Framework. I used their
[quickstart guide](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/quickstart/)
as a reference.

Currently, the project allows the user to view and edit the following paths:

```
{
    "authors": "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/authors/",
    "genres": "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/genres/",
    "books": "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/books/"
}
```

**Version 0.0.1:**

Created the basic Django boilerplate and data models.
